## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   A Firebase project with **Firestore** and **Authentication** enabled.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourBroIsACoder/ACC.git

    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="..."
    ```
    *   Update your `src/firebase/firebase.ts` file to read these variables.

    npm run dev
    ```
